All of the following, except the Menu and Weather at the bottom..., should be  image buttons  they must resize on rotate and fill the screen.   This is my starting point if you wish to use some special feature of [material design](https://material.google.com/)  such as [tabs](https://material.io/guidelines/components/tabs.html) or [navigation drawers](https://material.google.com/patterns/navigation-drawer.html) instead or as a complement to the UI you may do so provided you implement all of the app functionality specified and  it is visually appealing.    

There are whole [courses on UX design](https://www.udacity.com/course/ux-design-for-mobile-developers--ud849), I do not expect you to be experts  but there must be some effort.
