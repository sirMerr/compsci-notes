## Final Assignment The Evaluator	

## Description
Write the classes necessary to convert an infix expression to a postfix expression and then evaluate the postfix expression. The input to the evaluator is a queue containing the infix expression and the output is a queue with the result as the only entry.

The infix expression is made up of floating point numbers and four operators. The operators are `add(+)`, `subtract(-)`, `multiply(*)` and `division(/)`. You will also implement parenthesis `()` on the calculator.

Create a suite of Unit Tests that proves that the Evaluator and all of its components work as expected. Use parameterized testing so that you can carry out at least 25 different infix expressions in the testing. 

If the infix queue is not properly formatted then throw a named exception. Test that this exception is being thrown in at least 5 cases in addition to the 25 cases for evaluating a properly formatted queue.

You must write your own Stack and Queue for this assignment. You may not use the Java Collections for this assignment. 

There is no user interface just unit testing.
