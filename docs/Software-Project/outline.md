## Lab Activities

### Project

#### During the first 9 weeks of the term you will work individually on a project that will demonstrate your achievement of the appropriate objectives in this course. The project will be broken into four phases.

#### For Fall 2017 the project will be an Daily Planner program. The four phases of this project will be:

#### 1)        Design, implement, and unit test the database business and data classes

####         Due on September 18 10:00 AM

#### 2)        Design and implement the email business and data classes.

####         Due on September 25 10:00 AM

#### 3)        Design and implement a graphical user interface

####         Due on October 16 10:00 AM

#### 4)        Deliver the finished application.

####         Due on October 30 10:00 AM

#### Phases 1 must include unit tests. These tests will remain a part of the project till the end.

#### The project will be completed by October 10, 2017 or sooner. **There will be no extension.** Each phase is worth 25% of the total project mark. If one of the first three phases fails to meet the project requirements it may be resubmitted and a new grade not exceeding 80% of that phase&#39;s grade may be assigned. Failure to successfully complete any phase by October 30, 2017 will result in a maximum final project grade of 7/25 and a failure in the course.

#### **Individual Labs**

#### During the last 6 weeks of the course you will complete a series of assignments on the topic of data structures that will demonstrate your achievement of the appropriate objectives.

## Program rules and regulations

## For 420 career program courses, students must receive at least 50% on the assignment component and at least 60% on the examination component in order to obtain a passing grade for the course. Failure to do so will result in a maximum grade of 50 (the lower of 50 or the grade earned). For the purpose of this rule, quizzes are considered exams.**

Assignments are due at the due date specified by the instructor. Assignments received after this time are late. Assignments will not be accepted after due date set by instructor. In exceptional circumstances, such as illness, etc. labs submitted late will be graded provided that the student has received an extension from the instructor in advance.

Each student must submit their own individual answers to assignments, and shared solutions are not acceptable. Students must protect their work from being easily copied by others by introducing uniqueness into their work in the choice of images used, the display styles used in the presentation of documents, the originality of the written descriptive passages, and by placing digital signatures on their original images.

Students are reminded that they are responsible for all material presented in the lecture and during the lab, and are expected to obtain material they have missed.

Students must follow exactly the instructions in the lab exercises about how and where to store all computer files in order for their work to be accepted and properly evaluated.

_&quot;This course outline has been prepared in conformity with the_ **Institutional Student Evaluation Policy (I.S.E.P.)**_. The &quot;policy is designed to promote equitable and effective evaluation of student learning&quot; and is_ **therefore a crucial policy for you to read and understand** _. The policy describes the rights and obligations of students, faculty, departments, programs, and the College administration with regard to evaluation in all your courses._ **I.S.E.P.** _is published in the College Calendar and reference copies are available in the Library and in the offices of program chairs and the Dean of Social Science &amp; Business Technologies&quot;._

## DAWSON COLLEGE**

## COMPUTER SCIENCE DEPARTMENT**

## POLICIES**



## 1.        ACADEMIC INTEGRITY**

The Computer Science Department adheres to the Dawson College Academic Conduct policy. Students have an obligation to inform themselves of all aspects of this policy. According to ISEP, the teacher is required to report to the Sector Dean all cases of cheating and plagiarism affecting a student&#39;s grade. (ISEP Section IV-C) Students may appeal any decision of the teacher regarding cheating and plagiarism according to the methods established by the College. The penalty for cheating or plagiarism may range from a zero on the work to a failure in the course.

## 2.        ATTENDANCE AND LATENESS**

Students are responsible for all material covered in classes and labs, whether or not they are present. Students have an obligation to arrive on time and to remain for the duration of scheduled classes, labs and activities. Students who disregard this obligation may be asked to leave the class, lab or activity. Students should refer to the Institutional Student Evaluation Policy (ISEP Section III-C) regarding attendance.

## 3.        RELIGIOUS HOLIDAY OBSERVANCE**

Class period(s) may be cancelled in order that the teacher can observe religious holidays. Any material missed as a result, will be made up during labs, class periods and alternate tutorial sessions.

Students, who intend to observe religious holidays, must inform their teachers in writing as prescribed in the ISEP Policy on Religious Observances (ISEP Section III-D) Students absent from classes because of observance of religious holidays will not be penalized. It must be emphasized, however, that this College policy should not be interpreted to mean that a student can receive credit for work not performed. It is the student&#39;s responsibility to fulfill the requirements of the alternative arrangement.

## 4.        SOFTWARE**

The Computer Science Department forbids the use of the computer labs it uses to make any copies of any software without the explicit authorization of the Department. Apart from any legal action that might arise from such unauthorized copying, the Computer Science Department reserves the right to discipline any student involved in such activity.

Students who borrow software from the College and fail to return it will be placed on the defaulter list and be subject to the appropriate penalties.

Viruses are programs that attach themselves to a computer system without the permission of those to whom the system belongs. They are deliberately written to be, at worst, harmful (e.g. destroying the contents of disks) and, at best, bothersome (e.g. disturbing the image shown on the screen). They can cause serious losses of time and effort for students, staff and faculty. Any student involved in the deliberate spreading of viruses is subject to the most severe penalties prescribed by College regulations, apart from any legal action that might arise from such acts.

## 5.        LITERACY**

The Computer Science Department recognizes that literacy in all its forms (read, written, spoken) is essential to our students in their careers.

Teachers may choose to incorporate a literacy component into the marking scheme for any piece of work. Teachers may use their discretion to insist that any piece of work submitted for credit is revised by the student if it is unsatisfactory with regard to literacy.

Teachers will inform all students in their courses of this policy at the beginning of each semester either by including it in the course description or otherwise.

## 6.        CELL PHONES**

The use of cell phones in all Computer Science lectures, labs and exams is prohibited.

## 7.        PORTABLE COMPUTERS**

The use of portable computers in all Computer Science lectures for purposes other than note-taking is prohibited.

## 8.        STUDENT CONDUCT**

Everyone has the right to a safe and non-violent environment. Students are obliged to conduct themselves as stated in the Student Code of Conduct and in the ISEP section on the roles and responsibilities of students. (ISEP section II-D)

## 9.        INTENSIVE COURSE CONFLICTS**

If a student is attending an intensive course, the student must inform the teacher, within the first two weeks of class, of the specific dates of any anticipated absences.

## 10.        ISEP**

The Institutional Student Evaluation Policy (ISEP) is designed to promote equitable and effective evaluation of student learning and is therefore a crucial policy to read and understand. The policy describes the rights and obligations of students, faculty, departments, programs, and the College administration with regard to evaluation in all your courses, including grade reviews and resolution of academic grievance. The ISEP is available on the Dawson website.
