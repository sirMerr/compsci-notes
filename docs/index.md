## Introduction
Welcome to the wiki! ðŸŽ‰

These are my notes for Semester 5 of Dawson's Computer Science program. It consists, among other things, of PHP, Java, Android and Git.

This is a work in progress! To contribute or any other issues, ask [@sirMerr](https://github.com/sirMerr)

Unfortunately, many of the class notes use powerpoint, with many images, which are both a pain to transfer into Markdown since I have to upload images to a cdn, go through each pane to format the notes and delimiter the headers. Additionally, I may be too busy to keep the notes up to date. As so, you should rely on your own notes primarily (contributions always appreciated!)
