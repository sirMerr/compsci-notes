## Pass Line Casino Dice Game

The goal of this assignment is to reactivate your Java skills. You may use a console or GUI interface. In next weekâ€™s labs I will sit with you and we will do a code review of your work.

## Rules

In this game you roll the dice (called the come-out roll) and look at the total. If this total is equal to 7 or 11, then you win the amount of the bet. If the total is equal to 2, 3 or 12, then you lose the bet. Any other total of the dice becomes the "point", and you continue to roll the dice until you either (a) roll the point total again, in which case you win the amount of the bet, or (b) roll a total of 7, in which case you lose the amount of the bet. If the total of the dice is not 7 and not equal to the point, then you roll again, and continue to roll, until either condition (a) or (b) is met. Once the point has been determined, it does not change for subsequent rolls of the dice.

The game will begin by asking the user how much money they have to start with. The game will run until the player exits or the total money drops to zero. Each time the game is played ask the user for the amount they wish to bet. If they win then this amount is added to their total and if they loose it is subtracted from their total. After each game display whether they won or lost, how much total money they have and ask if they want to play again. If they do not want to play again then the program exits.
